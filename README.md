To use this library for a lumped model simulatino in MATLAB, first run the slblocks.m file in +C_uF folder.
You may get a pop up where you may need to add the file to path. Simply select that option.
While in the same directory, while in +C_uF folder, run the command ssc_build(). This will regenerate the library necessary to create custom circuits.
Then, in the Home tab, click on Simulink. You may create a new file o look at "untitled.slx"
